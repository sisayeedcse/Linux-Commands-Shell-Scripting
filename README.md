## Course Overview

This course is designed to provide hands-on experience with Linux commands and shell scripting. You will learn essential concepts such as navigating the filesystem, managing processes, and automating tasks using Bash scripting. The course includes the following key components:

* **Linux Command Line Basics**: Fundamental commands and their usage.
* **Text Processing**: Using tools like `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, and `cut` to process data.
* **File and Directory Management**: Creating, deleting, moving, and manipulating files and directories.
* **Permissions**: Understanding file permissions and managing access.
* **Shell Scripting**: Writing and debugging Bash scripts for automation.
* **Advanced Scripting**: Using loops, conditionals, and functions to build complex scripts.

## Installation

To get started with the course materials, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linux-commands-shell-scripting.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

   ```bash
   cd linux-commands-shell-scripting
   ```

3. Make sure you have a compatible Linux environment or install a Linux distribution in a virtual machine (VM) or use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) if you're on Windows.

## Usage

Once you've cloned the repository and set up your environment, you can begin practicing the commands and scripts provided in the course.

1. **Exploring Commands**: Open a terminal and run the commands and scripts directly from the `scripts/` folder.

2. **Running Shell Scripts**: Make any `.sh` script executable by running:

   ```bash
   chmod +x script_name.sh
   ./script_name.sh
   ```

3. **Exercise Solutions**: Each exercise is contained within a separate folder, and each script or command is provided with explanations and outputs.

## Course Topics

* **Basic Linux Commands**

  * Navigating directories: `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`
  * File management: `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`, `cat`, `chmod`, `chown`
  * Searching: `find`, `grep`, `locate`

* **Advanced File Management**

  * Using `tar` and `zip` for archiving
  * `ln` for creating symbolic links

* **Text Processing**
